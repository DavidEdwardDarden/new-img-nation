          New Image Nation uses images as a medium to streamline the creation 
          of new composite imagery. Creating imagery from scratch takes a lot of time 
          and involves a unique process. Creating an composite image, built with multiple 
          layers of imagery involves a new creative process. If you think about the way 
          music is composed, it is very similar. Musicians can take an element of a song 
          and use it to create new music. Not starting from scratch allows the creative 
          process to flow much more smoothly and your thoughts can be realized on a much 
          more natural level. There are barriers created by copyright laws that have 
          shackled designers from using images purely as a medium. While the law must be 
          followed, New Image Nation anticipates changes in the law that will allow for a 
          new methodology of image creation. When it comes to using images found online to 
          create a new image it takes imagination and creativity.

          Creativity is defined as the use of imagination or original ideas. Nothing 
          (or very few things) can be purely original. Everything that is created is 
          a combination of different elements. This being said, creativity is all about 
          combining things together in a unique way. Pure creativity though is something 
          that has never been seen and as such will not be understood. There is an 
          interesting relationship between understanding and creativity. Using imagery 
          as a medium allows creative production within the appropriate boundaries between 
          creativity and understanding.
